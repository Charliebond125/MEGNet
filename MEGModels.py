 Convolutional Neural Network models for MEG Signal Processing and Classification, 
 using Keras and Tensorflow

 Requirements:
    (1) tensorflow == 2.X (as of this writing, 2.0 - 2.3 have been verified
        as working)
 
 To run the EEG/MEG ERP classification sample script, you will also need

    (4) mne >= 0.17.1
    (5) PyRiemann >= 0.2.5
    (6) scikit-learn >= 0.20.1
    (7) matplotlib >= 2.2.3
    
 To use:
    
    (1) git clone https://github.com/Charliebond125/MEGNet.git
    (2) Import the model as
        
        from MEGNet.MEGModels import MEGNet    
        
        model = MEGNet(nb_classes = ..., Chans = ..., Samples = ...)
        
    (3) Then compile and fit the model
    
        model.compile(loss = ..., optimizer = ..., metrics = ...)
        fitted    = model.fit(...)
        predicted = model.predict(...)
