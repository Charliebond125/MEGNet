# MEGNet
Using EEGNet and converting this into MEGNet for use with Magnetoenecalography Data. Includes a Preprocessing Pipeline, and Variations of EEGNet converted for use in MEG Datasets.

##########################################################

To note - Code is still a work in progress.

Pipeline may be subject to change.

Pipeline includes a variety of processing steps involved in the pre-processing stage of MEG data. As is often the case, MEG captures a high temporal spatial accuracy within recordings, however the noise to signal ratio (along with EEG) is often low. This pipeline will at first serve a basic purpose in shuttling and preparing epochs to be used within a EEGNet model (available here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlawhern/arl-eegmodels/master/EEGModels.py and

EEGNet is Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras, but further experimentation may take place in utilizing PyTorch.
